                    <p>Welcome! My name is Zhiyao Tian, this is my first year studying at University of Queensland, and my major is Information Technology.
                        In the process of becoming a good programmer, I am still a beginner, but I am passionate about learning programming. After studying
                        DECO7180 this semester, I found that designing and exploring interaction with users is really interesting!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>I also hope to make more friends. If you want to make new friends, or want to discuss problems encountered in programming learning, 
                        you are welcome to contact me!
                    </p>

                        We need to look for data of interest on the data.qld.gov.au website, design an interactive website prototype based on the data, 
                        and design a poster to help your audience understand your webpage. The poster needs to include your design concept and your 
                        target audience, also need to include your simple interaction process and an ideal persona.

                    <p>I chose Queensland's marine pollution data in recent years, and wanted to build an interactive website that can help my audience users 
                        (environmentalists, students studying marine environment, etc.) quickly find pollution on the map.

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>&#9830; We need to submit a concept document of our project, we need to focus on the selected data, and user interaction.</li>
                        <li>&#9830; We also need to pitch our document and our idea through Discord &reg;, we need to create a slide to visulize our document.</li>

                    <h3>My Task</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>&#9830; Collected inspiration of our project and summarized the results of the group discussion.</li>
                        <li>&#9830; Made a cover image for our part-A document using Adobe illustrator.</li>
                        <li>&#9830; Completed the introduction, website scope, background & inspiration & research part of the document.</li>
                        <li>&#9830; Prepared a pitch for the content of the above sections.</li>

                    <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>&#9830; I think the partA of our group is very successful, and we made a good start for our group’s project. 
                            After our group's meetings and discussions in the previous few weeks, we decided to use wildlife data as the data support 
                            for our project. We will design a web page that allows users to select different animal data in the database and display them 
                            on the map to help users find the animals they want to find. We will also provide users with suggestions for camping in the wild
                            to help users specify what they belong to Your own travel plan.We also plan to provide users with a travel recommendation function 
                            to help users find the nearest campsite to the animal they are searching for.Our team members have accomplished everyone's tasks brilliantly,
                            but I think I may not be well prepared when pitching, leading to the problem of excessive speaking speed, this is something I need to overcome.

                        <li>&#9830; We need to determine the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of our group project, and improve the interactive map of our project based on the MVP.</li>
                        <li>&#9830; We also need to make a DEMO of our webpage to show to our audience during the speech. Demo needs to build the basic html/css of the project.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h3>My Task</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>&#9830; Completed html/css establishment of the project camping page.</li>
                        <li>&#9830; Designed the logo for our final project using Adobe illustrator.</li>
                        <li>&#9830; As one of the makers of the slideshow, I made corresponding visual pictures for the pitch.</li>
                        <li>&#9830; Added basic map interaction functions to our group’s DEMO interaction through leaflet.js, for example, click to set an icon on the map,
                            display an animal on the map (simulated, SLQ data not used).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        <p>
                            In the process of creating the DEMO of our final project, we found that there are
                            some functions in our original plan were too different to achieve. Such as finding 
                            the nearest campsite to the animal, considering the tight time of this semester, 
                            we decided to cancel this function.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Overall, I think our team successfully completed partB. We discussed the Minimum 
                            Viable Product (MVP) of our project, which means that we will use our mvp to 
                            complete our final project (partC), and we also decided to compare our mvp with 
                            the mvp of other groups during the pitch to check if there is any improvement in our mvp.
                            After the pitch, our group discussed the progress of our group project. I think our
                            progress was a little behind at the time, so we decided to allocate all parts of the 
                            project to each member as soon as possible, because it is difficult to allocate time 
                            this semester, and It is taught online, so we decided to make sure to achieve the MVP of the project.

                            Through the joint efforts of the team members for several weeks, we successfully completed our project.
                             I am very satisfied with our project. We have added some new functions on the basis of MVP. On the day 
                             of the tradeshow, we provided users with visual files and links to the project so that users can better 
                             understand our project. Several users who came to visit also expressed a positive attitude, which made me feel very fulfilled.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, due to online lectures, the audience’s interactive experience may be reduced, and due to time constraints, 
                            we have not considered sufficient responsive design, so we cannot determine what device users use to interact.
                            After the course is over, we should continue to improve the content, and you are welcome to provide suggestions 
                            for our projects via email.Looking back on the entire course, from the initial brainstorming to the final completion of our
                            project, each of our members was very serious and tried their best to complete the tasks assigned to them, but due to online 
                            reasons, the sense of accomplishment brought about by cooperation weakened a lot.

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>&#9830; For the portfolio, I designed to show my achievements and evolution of our final project - Wild Queensland, I choose to
                            detailed my contribution to our project and express my own reflection on each part.
                        </li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h3>What did I do?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>&#9830; Find inspiration and use Miro &reg; to build a wireframe for my portfolio.</li>
                        <li>&#9830; Organize screenshots/evidences of each stage of the course to enrich the content of the portfolio.</li>
                        <li>&#9830; Determine the overall design style and color style and some animation effects for my portfolio.</li>
                        <li>&#9830; Make web pages using html, css and javascript.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Portfolio Reflection</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>&#9830; I think the portfolio has successfully demonstrated my personal contribution to the team at each stage of the 
                            completion of the project, and reflected on each stage. My inspiration comes from the personal portfolio 
                            of Anastasia Laczko provided to us. The content of each part of the portfolio is based on the journal entry
                            I wrote and the reflections in the submitted documents. In the process of making the portfolio, I also learned a lot 
                            of content that I had not learned before. I am also very happy to complete the web design alone as a designer. Of course,
                            my web page also has many areas that need to be improved in the future, such as responsive design. The application of
                            perfection and accessibility, but due to the lack of time left for me, I will improve these content in the future.

                <div class="title-container">
                    <h1>Course Relection</h1>
                </div>
                <div id="cou-text">
                    <h3>Course Expectations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>&#9830; In my first journal entry, I expressed my concern: "Since this is my first year of studying at uq, 
                            I am not confident enough in my programming ability. Since this is a teamwork project, I am worried that I 
                            will drag the team’s back", but after finishing the course, I think my worries are meaningless. In order 
                            to pass the course smoothly, I learned a lot of content in my spare time and actively discussed with the 
                            group members and asked for advice. When I finally completed the map interactive function of our project, 
                            I felt very satisfied because I completed what I had set Under the target, and resolved the initial concerns.
                        </li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h3>What did I learn from the course</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>&#9830; The most important thing is that I have learned teamwork skills. Since this semester is taught online, 
                            communication has become more difficult, which means we need to spend more energy in teamwork. This is also 
                            a problem that may arise in future work, so we should always be prepared for possible changes. The second is 
                            the improvement of programming ability. Through the semester of this semester, I think my programming ability 
                            has been improved, which also laid the foundation for future courses.
                        </li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h3>The course itself</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>&#9830; I think the course should have more connections with students, which may be due to online teaching. 
                            I feel that the connection between courses and students is not close enough. Secondly, I think the course 
                            can be arranged for later study, because this way we can build a better webpage, because some students chose 
                            this course in the first semester of uq, which makes them struggle and may cost other students 2 Time to complete 
                            the tasks assigned to them. I think this will increase the pressure on the students. Another point I think is the
                            allocation of assessments. Too many assessments sometimes make me feel frustrated, for example, the preparation 
                            of personal reflections sometimes conflicts with the reporting of our group, too many presentations to prepare 
                            and visual documents during the speech will also make me feel tired.
